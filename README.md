Art Survey is used to enter information about valuable departmentally owned art. In this context, we use “art” to include all valuable objects. These might range from a painting, to valuable gems, to antique instruments, and might be on display or stored in the back of a cupboard. 
This listing does not apply to collections in LSA's research or public museums. Mounted posters and pictures, book covers and other such items that do not have significant value (nominally under $1000) should not be entered.
